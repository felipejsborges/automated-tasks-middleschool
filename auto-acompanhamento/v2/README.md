### What is? 🤔
A program to automatically fill google sheets that are used to manage activities in quarentine period.
<hr>

### How does this activities works? ⚙️
Teachers does not need to fill the sheets anymore (like they do when using [v1](https://github.com/felipejsborges/automated-tasks-middleschool/tree/master/auto-acompanhamento/v1)), because I create some scripts to do this job automatically.<br>
<hr>

### What does this program do? 🤖
- Get responses of Google Forms student activities
- Fill a database with these responses
- Fill cell on sheet with a "X" if that student (line) has done the activity of that subject (column), by consulting the database
<hr>

### Which technologies were used? 💻
- Google App Scripts
<hr>

### Look at the final result 📺
I created a [video in Portuguese-BR]() that I show more details. Watch it!
