### What is? 🤔
A program to automate Excel workbooks that are used to manage activities in quarentine period.
<hr>

### How does this activities works? ⚙️
1. A template was send to education coordinator of the school, and he has to create one workbook for each class
2. He needed to fill it with school name, class, and students name.
3. Teachers fill this worksheet during the week and the coordinator has to create another worksheet for the next week, in the same workbook, for each class, every week<br>
So, he comes to me asking for help, and I created this program to help him.
<hr>

### What does this program do? 🤖
- Create a workbook for each class, based on the template
- Copy data of our intern database to fill the activities workbook
- Generate a worksheet in every workbook for the week we want<br>
Obs.: I made it very quickly because I already have a program for a similar task. [Check it here!](../auto-conselho)
<hr>

### Which technologies were used? 💻
- Visual Basic for Applications
- Auto Hotkey
<hr>

### Look at the final result 📺
I created a [video in Portuguese-BR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkH7Zp7cqhc) that I show this program and the another one used in the similar task. Watch it!
