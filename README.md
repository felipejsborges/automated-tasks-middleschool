### What technologies were used? ‚öôÔ∏è
- [VBA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/): Visual Basic for Applications is an implementation of Microsoft's Visual Basic 6 to be used in Microsoft Office applications.

- [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/): AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to easily create small to complex scripts for all kinds of tasks such as: auto-clicking, macros, etc. To help with it, I used [Pulover's Macro Creator](https://github.com/Pulover/PuloversMacroCreator), a Free Automation Tool and Script Generator based on AHK language. The macros can be executed from the program itself or you can export them to AutoHotkey Script format.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): One of the most popular language nowadays. I used it to do simple tasks that help the main ones, like applying regular expressions.

- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/): Used in this tasks to get data of websites using HTTP requests.
