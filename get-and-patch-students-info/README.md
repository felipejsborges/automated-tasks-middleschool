### What is? 🤔
Two scripts to get data of a system and update what we want.
<hr>

### How does this activities works? ⚙️
1. Check students documents of the entire school (~870 students) with our intern database
2. Loot at the city's and state's system, checking students documents with our database. City's system provides us a database with all students documents, so we can check it. But state's system does not. So we have to search of each student, open them information and check the document.
3. Update document of each student that is wrong.
<hr>

### What does this program do? 🤖
- Get, of state's system, all documents of each student automatically (~1min for all students of the school)
- Update information we need, using a BOT. Very quickly and with less chance of errors.

### Which technologies were used? 💻
- JavaScript
- Python

### Look at the final result 📺
I created a [video in Portuguese-BR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBezj6adLW4) that I show these scripts working. Watch it!
