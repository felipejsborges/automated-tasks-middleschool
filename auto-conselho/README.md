### What is? 🤔
A program to automate the digital part of a class council of a middle school.
<hr>

### How does a class council works? ⚙️
1. Superiors sends me an Excel workbook template
2. I have to create one workbook for each class
3. I fill it with school name, class, year, teacher's name and students information (name and birthday)
4. Teachers fill notes and observations during next two months
5. I print every filled worksheets
6. Happens the council with students, teachers and some parents
7. I generate a school report for each student and print it to be delivered at Parents Meeting
<hr>

### When I started to work in it, we had to 🛠️
- Create a copy of the template for each one by one
- Copy data of an intern workbook with students data to each early created workbook one by one
- Format every worksheet, every time it need to be printed
- Generate school reports one class at a time, and fix page breaks to be printed correctly
<hr>

### What does this program do? 🤖
- Create a workbook for each class, based on the template
- Copy data of our intern database to fill the council workbook
- Format worksheets automatic when it need to be printed
- Generate all school reports at a time, fixing page breaks
<hr>

### Which technologies were used? 💻
- Visual Basic for Applications
- Auto Hotkey
<hr>

### Look at the final result 📺
I created a [video in Portuguese-BR]() that I show this program and another one used in a similar task. Watch it!
